# **Advance Therapy**

The official website of Advance Therapy, a Guelph based health services provider specializing in brain injury rehabilitation.

For more information see [atherapy.ca](http://atherapy.ca/).

## **Layout and Frameworks**

The site uses custom css classes built around an atomic/functional css approach. Classes were created to address single use styles that could be reused numerous times to reinforce a DRY code approach.

## **JS**

1. jQuery slideDown effect with hide and show functionality is the basis of the site layout. Each panel when clicked drops down to reveal hidden content.

2. Page scroll to ID: an excellent library by Malihu provides jquery smooth scrolling. This library is particularly smooth and used for its simplicity and results.
