# **Advance Therapy**

The official website of Advance Therapy, a Guelph based health services provider specializing in brain injury rehabilitation.

For more information see [atherapy.ca](http://atherapy.ca/).

## **Structure**

This site uses bootstrap 3 of decentral.ca is essentially the same though uses [SWUP](https://github.com/gmrchk/swup) as a framework for AJAX page transitions and the addition of entrance/exit animation classes. Like smoothstate, this gives the site an app feel, as pages do not reload, view changes are fast, the initial page load is light, and it is easily extensible with simple (or complex) css animations.

## **Layout and Frameworks**

The site uses custom css classes built around an atomic/functional css approach. Classes were created to address single use styles that could be reused numerous times to reinforce a DRY code approach.

## **JS**

1. jQuery slideDown effect with hide and show functionality is the basis of the site layout. Each panel when clicked drops down to reveal hidden content.

2. Page scroll to ID: an excellent library by Malihu provides jquery smooth scrolling. This library is particularly smooth and used for its simplicity and results.
